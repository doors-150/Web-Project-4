              Naawi-Oodena is a thriving urban reserve that went through years of
              legal battles and construction to become a reality. This page covers
              the history of the land that became Naawi-Oodena and the legal
              battles that helped make this project possible. For information
              about the types of construction in this urban reserve, go to the
              <a href="page1.html">about</a>

            <!--Article that explains the history of Naawi-Oodena-->
            <p>
              Up until 2004, the current place that is Naawi-Oodena used to be known
              as the Kapyong Barracks, a place where people in the Canadian Army
              were. Eventually though, the unit moved to a training base called CFB
              Shilo, abandoning the barracks. Three years later in 2007, a company
              called the Treasury Board of Canada attempted to sell the entire 64
              hectares of land to the Canada Lands Company, however, it was by law
              that the indigenous actually were entitled to the land and it
              should've been given to them. The First Nations people noticed this
              and filed a lawsuit against the government.

              This legal battle was supposed to end in 2009 when the court sided
              with the indigenous, and prevented the land transfer from happening.
              But the Treasury Board of Canada refused to give up and kept fighting
              against this, as they could still get help from the federal
              government. What the company didn't realize though, is that the First
              Nations people would not give up either.

            <p>
              In 2015, Stephen Harper was the prime minister at that time. He "met
              with local first nations leaders" and decided to stop appealing the
              Treasury Board of Canada. In 2018, the buildings in the Kapyong
              Barracks started being demolished and on August 30th, 2019, the
              government signed a deal that would give the land to the indigenous
              people. After 10 years, they finally won.

            <p>
              In March 2021, the Treaty 1 Development Corporation released the
              Kapyong Barracks Master Plan to the public, which is the document
              that contains information on all the buildings and houses that will
              be developed on the land. A month later on April 14th, the name
              "Naawi-Oodena" was given to this urban reserve.

              Finally, on July 20th, 2022, the city of Winnipeg agreed to provide
              services to Naawi-Oodena and help with developing the master plan.
              Construction three years later on April 16th, 2024 and ended fairly
              recently on October 26th, 2040. For more information on the
              construction, visit the <a href="page1.html">about</a> page.
