      <article>
        <h1 id="low-density">Low Density Residential</h1>
        <p>
          Construction of lower density houses were a part of the first phase of
          the Naawi-Oodena construction. Most of the low-density areas were
          developed by the CLC (Canada Lands Company).
        </p>

          <img src="Images/low-density.png" alt="A picture of some low-density houses in the Naawi-Oodena neighborhood.
          There are some brown single-family houses along a road."/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          These lower-density houses were all made on the left side of the land.
          With beautiful single-family homes, visually appealing semi-detached
          homes, duplexes and high-quality townhouses, this area blends in with
          the rich neighborhood of Tuxedo, which is right beside the urban
          reserve. The maximum height of any building in this area is 3.5
          storeys (12 meters). If you like having a ton of space and nobody to
          bother you, then this is the perfect place to live.
        </p>

      <!--Article that explains medium-density areas-->
      <article>
        <h1 id="medium-density">Medium Density Residential</h1>
        <p>
          Construction of the majority of houses here are medium-density. They
          cover multiple parts of Naawi-Oodena and were developed by both CLC
          and Treaty 1 Development Corp.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="Images/medium-density.png" 
          width="50%" height="50%" alt="A picture of some pedestrians in the Naawi-Oodena neighborhood,
          along with some apartments that are medium-sized in terms of height."/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Making up the majority of houses on this land, you can find low-to-mid
          rise apartments, multi-unit buildings, stacked townhomes, and many
          live work units. This area provides high-quality, diverse options for housing, for everybody.
          The maximum height for the houses here is 6 storeys (20 meters), and most buildings contain 30 to 60 units per acre.
          There are also small convenience stores in these areas.
          If you like having a little more affordable housing, along with a bit of walkability, then this is a good place to live.

      <!--Article that explains mixed-use village areas-->
      <article>
        <h1 id="mixed-use">Mixed-use Village</h1>
        <p>
          Construction of the Mixed-use Village is a combination of high-density
          housing with commercial service, retail, and other pedestrian-friendly
          environments. This area covers a small part of the land, mostly along
          Grant Ave. Just like medium density, it was equally developed by both
          companies.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="Images/mixed-use-village.png" 
          width="50%" height="50%" alt="A picture of the mixed-use village in the Naawi-Oodena neighborhood.
          It is extremely dense, with all kinds of services everywhere with a lot of pedestrians and a cyclist."/>
        </figure>
        <p>This small area plays a massive part in the urban reserve. It has a mix of uses,
          like commercial, office and cultural. There are also high-quality multi-unit buildings to live in.
          This place looks amazing visually, and is very walkable too. Just like the medium-density area,
          it has diverse options for housing.
          The maximum height for buildings here is the same as Medium-density (6 storeys, 20 meters), 
          and these have 40-60 units per acre. 
          There are no car sales, services, washes, gas stations, or drive-thrus here,
          but there is a rapid-transit station.
          If you love having everything obtainable within a few-minute walk, then this place is perfect.

      <!--Article that explains commercial mixed-use areas-->
      <article>
        <h1 id="commercial">Commercial Mixed-use</h1>
        <p>
          Commercial Mixed-use is where most retail services, offices, and
          cultural facilities are. It covers most of the area around Route 90
          (Kenaston Blvd) and was mostly developed by T1DC (Treaty One
          Development Corporation).
        </p>

          width="50%" height="50%" alt="The commercial mixed-use part of Naawi-Oodena. 
          All the services listed below are in this image."/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          This takes up the majority of the land,
          and most of these places allow motorists, pedestrians and cyclists to access them.
          All buildings look good and are high-quality. The kinds of buildings that are in this area include but are not limited to:
          <ul>
            <li>Retail Stores</li>
            <li>Offices</li>
            <li>Restaurants</li>

            <li>And a few residential buildings.</li>
          </ul>
          The maximum height of all buildings here is 6 storeys (22.5 meters), and there are almost no houses here.

      <!--Article that explains community space areas-->
      <article>
        <h1 id="community-space">Community Spaces</h1>
        <p>
          The Community Spaces have public parks, open spaces and other outdoor
          community areas where you can go. This area is in between the lower
          density, medium density, and mixed-use village neighborhoods so
          everyone can access these community spaces. It was equally developed
          by the two companies.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="Images/community-space.png" alt="One of the community spaces in Naawi-Oodena.
          There is a slide with kids playing on it and some benches."/>
        </figure>
        <p>Along with being public places, these community spaces also show some indigenous culture,
          like their art. These spaces are also be used as gathering places,
          and have plant species and materials native to Manitoba. 
          The community spaces look beautiful and are sustainable,
          while also being flexible and being able to be used all-year.

      <article>
        <h1 id="sports-recreation">Sports and Recreation</h1>
        <p>
          The Sports and Recreation Facility is a space where you can go for
          recreation and playing sports. It covers a small part of land and is
          fully developed by Treaty 1 Development Corp.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="Images/sports-and-recreation.png" 
          width="50%" height="50%" alt="The Sports and Recreation facility. 
          Adults and kids are playing basketball here in front of the building."/>
        </figure>
        <p>These recreation facilities are used for both indoor and outdoor use.
          They are also used for entertainment and cultural uses, along with some retail and commercial use.
          Just like the commercial mixed-use area, this place is accessible to motorists, cyclists and pedestrians.
          A nice area to come to if you like sports and exercise.
        </p>
      </article>
      <!--Article that explains cultural campus area-->
      <article>
        <h1 id="cultural-campus">Cultural Campus and Education</h1>
        <p>
          The Cultural Campus and Education Facility is a space for educating
          people on indigenous history and culture. It covers a small part of
          the land around Taylor Ave, and is equally developed by both
          companies.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="Images/cultural-campus.png" 
          width="50%" height="50%" alt="The cultural campus buildings at night.
          Includes the gallery and treaty one administrative building."/>
        </figure>
        <p>
          This is one of the most important places in this urban reserve.
          There is an administrative centre for the Treaty One company,
          which is also used as a meeting space.
          There will also be a campus here for learning and community buildings,
          along with museums, galleries, spaces for performing, and public libraries,
          all to showcase indigenous culture and provide an opportunity for reconciliation.
          Just like Commercial Mixed-Use and the Sports/Recreation areas,
          you can access this place no matter what form of transportation you choose.
